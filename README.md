## Backend

### Architecture
Although this was a small challenge, I chose to use Clean Architecture to demonstrate my ability to work with this architectural pattern and to bring a market-recognized standard to the project.

#### Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture separates business logic from external concerns like databases or frameworks. It promotes testability, maintainability, and a clear dependency flow from the outer layers to the core.

### Features
 - API documentation
 - Input validation with class-validator
 - Containerization
 - Unit tests

## Frontend

### Architecture
For the frontend, I opted for a feature-based architecture due to its simplicity, ease of use, and the decoupling it offers compared to the traditional React structure where components and interfaces are often tightly coupled.

#### Feature Based Architecture
Feature-based architecture is a software design approach where the project structure is organized around specific functionalities or features, rather than technical layers.

<strong> Commands </strong>
<pre>
  - npm run dev // Starts the frontend in development mode using Vite
  - npm run build // Compiles TypeScript and builds the project using Vite
  - npm run lint // Runs ESLint to check for linting issues
  - npm run preview // Serves the production build locally using Vite
  - npm run test // Runs all tests using Vitest
  - npm run test:ui // Opens the Vitest UI for interactive testing
  - npm run test:coverage // Runs tests and generates a coverage report
  - npm run storybook // Starts Storybook on port 6006 for UI component development
  - npm run build-storybook // Builds the static Storybook for production
</pre>

### Features
  - Component documentation with Storybook
  - Containerization
  - Unit tests

<h2>Final Notes</h2>

How was it developed?
I focused on decoupling components on the frontend, writing unit tests, input validations, and implementing the required features as described in the challenge. I also compared results against the documentation to ensure correctness.

### Challenges
- Understanding the amortization calculation
- Verifying amortization values to ensure accuracy
- Frontend testing (Iâ€™m a bit out of practice)
- Bringing clean architecture and containerization into a single-day project

### Possible Improvements
- Add realistic scenarios and graphs for amortization as seen in the provided documentation
- Introduce more advanced design patterns as the project grows
- Benchmark performance to evaluate the use of memoized functions and classes
- Create smaller, custom, reusable components for the frontend, such as input and button
- Add observability
- Implement production deployment logic
- Add automated tests for the most critical user flows, both frontend and backend
- Implement regression tests on the frontend
- Implement load testing
- Implement end-to-end testing
- Create a token system for translation support
- Add a notification system (Toaster) for errors and alerts
